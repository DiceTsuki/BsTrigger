BsTrigger 1.0
========================================

A simple Python scripts / app to trigger BlueStacks':

1. FPS Uncap

2. FPS Counter

BsTrigger was build and tested with Python 3.7.6 .


How to "Install"
========================================

There are 2 options:

1. Install Python 3.7.x (https://www.python.org/downloads/), extract "BsTrigger" (bstrigger_1_0_src.zip) directory and open Bstrigger.py .

2. Extract "BsTrigger" (bstrigger_1_0_win_x86_exec.zip / bstrigger_1_0_win_x86_exec_noconsole.zip / the x86_64 counterparts) directory and open BsTrigger.exe . No Python installation required.

Note:

Option 2: For Windows OS < Windows 10, you might need to install VCRedist 2015 x86 / x64 (https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=48145) first.
As outlined here: https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html#windows


1st Time Use
========================================

1. You need to import Installer_XXXX.log (XXXX = BlueStacks version number e.g. 4.150.10.6302) or BlueStacksUsers.log to get the required parameters.

2. Refer to (3) for the files' location.

3. Log Directory: BlueStacks Installation Directory\Logs (e.g. C:\Program Data\BlueStacks\Logs).

4. VM Data Directory: BlueStacks Installation Directory\Engine (e.g. C:\Program Data\BlueStacks\Engine).

5. The minimum required values for BsTrigger to work properly are: Log Directory, VM Data Directory and API Token.


How to "Uninstall"
========================================

Just delete the extracted directory.
All files that were generated by BsTrigger are in the directory.


Additional Notes
========================================

1. FPS Uncap (AKA TURBO):

	- If you set it to at least double of the FPS set in BlueStacks Settings, some apps / games might double their FPS cap e.g. from 30 to 60 FPS.
	- Tested on Love Live! School Idol Festival: All Stars which has ~30 FPS cap in the menu.
	- You can replicate this without BsTrigger by:
		- Set the BlueStacks FPS to "A" FPS (e.g. 60 FPS) > Close BlueStacks.
		- Open BlueStacks > Settings > Engine > Enable High Frame Rate > Set the new FPS to at least double of "A" FPS (e.g. 120 FPS).
		- Open the targeted app / game.
	- The effect will be lost once BlueStacks is closed. The steps in (c) need to be repeated to regain the effect.
	- The FPS cap set by BsTrigger will not change the FPS set in BlueStacks Settings. It will only execute the function to trigger the cap change.

	WARNING:
	If you DISABLE Vertical SYNC (VSYNC) for BlueStacks in your Graphic Card's Control Panel, the BlueStacks FPS cap will be the same as TURBO FPS.
	Enable VSync or use FPS Limiter (Built-in inside Graphic Card's Control Panel or 3rd-party tools such as RivaTuner Statistics Server).
	And cap it to your monitor's refresh rate so that screen tearing / overheating can be prevented.

2. FPS Counter:

	Similar to FPS Uncap, this will not change the FPS counter set in BlueStacks Settings. It will only trigger the function for FPS counter display.

3. bs.cfg:

	A JSON-formatted file generated by BsTrigger to save the required BlueStacks Parameters.

4. inst.cfg:

	A JSON-formatted file generated by BsTrigger to save instance-specific options (Turbo FPS, Bs Android Port and HD-Player Port).

5. BlueStacks Variants (MSI App Player etc.):

	BsTrigger was tested on MSI App Player (4.150.10.6302) and BlueStacks (4.180.10.1006). Might or might not work on other variants.

6. To BlueStacks Devs:
	
	Maybe the "trigger" for these features can be placed somewhere in the "MENU" where "PIN TO TOP" and "STREAMING MODE" are now?
